SOSCONF is the first global open source technology summit organized by students for non-profit community. Based on the concept of open source, the summit encourages students to enjoy open source, understand open source, participate in open source, contribute to open source, and get practice and fun from open source. The summit is held in different cities and countries every year to establish an active, diverse and pure technical community focusing on learning and the future for students, so that students from different countries can actively communicate, stand on the international stage, and show their ideas in the laboratory. The conference was held at the University of Southern California and Chengdu University of Electronic Science and Technology. In this conference, all the organizers, volunteers and speakers are made up of current students. Audience status is not limited. As part of the X program, Chinese will be the main language used in this event.
